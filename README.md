# Introduction

Based on the [Consumer Behavior and Shopping Habits](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zeesolver/consumer-behavior-and-shopping-habits-dataset/data) dataset from Kaggle, this project analyzes customer behavior to classify and predict whether a customer has opted in for a subscription service. The goal is to assess customer loyalty and estimate the potential for recurring revenue.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Dataset:** `shopping_behavior_updated.csv` (3,900 rows √ó 18 columns)  
- **Missing values:** None  
- **Duplicates:** None  

### Key Findings

#### 1. Subscription Information
- **73%** of customers do **not** subscribe; **27%** subscribe  
- No female customer has subscribed; only male customers do  
- Subscription rates rise when discounts are applied; with no discount, subscription = 0%  

#### 2. Customer Characteristics
- Majority are middle-aged or older  
  - These groups spend more and make repeat purchases more often  
- Purchases tend to be either mid-range (20‚Äì40 USD) or high-end (90‚Äì100 USD)  
- Clothing is the top category  
- Free shipping is the most chosen delivery option  

#### 3. Gender Differences
- **68%** of customers are male  
- Males shop about once every three months; females about twice per week 
- Males only buy on discount; females buy at full price more often  
- Males prefer spring; females prefer autumn
- Although females have a higher average order value, total male order value is nearly double due to larger customer base and more frequent repeat purchases  

#### 4. Customer Satisfaction
- Ratings indicate high satisfaction; every customer makes at least one repeat purchase  

### Solution 
*Although this is a modeling problem focused on prediction, based on the insights from my EDA, I would like to suggest some solutions to help improve the company‚Äôs subscription rate. This section is provided as a bonus.*

The data shows that every customer has made at least one repeat purchase. This means customers are very satisfied with the products and services. It also proves that the company has built a good reputation and high service quality, which creates a strong foundation to develop more value-added programs for customers.

**1. Launching a First-time Subscription Offer**

The statistics reveal that the subscription rate increases significantly when discounts are offered, especially among male customers. This group makes up the majority and has a high subscription rate, but they are much more likely to subscribe if there are promotions. Based on this, the company should launch a First-time Subscription Offer such as giving a discount code or a gift to customers who complete their subscription. At the same time, the company should keep offering special promotions on occasions like birthdays or holidays to attract more customers to subscribe to the service.

**2. Shipping Discount Codes**

Most customers prefer free shipping. The company can use this to encourage more subscriptions, for example, by giving regular shipping discount codes or offering free shipping only for subscribed customers.

**3. Special Benefits for Subscribed Customers to Create a FOMO Effect**

In addition to these direct incentives, it is also very important to communicate clearly about the special benefits for subscribed customers. Using channels like the website, app, or in-store banners to promote exclusive offers for subscribed users can create a FOMO (fear of missing out) effect. This is especially effective for curious customers who have not yet subscribed, encouraging them to take action.

**4. Simplifying the Subscription Process for All Customers**

The subscription process should be made as simple as possible. Most customers are middle-aged or older, so if the subscription steps are complicated or time-consuming, the company may lose many potential customers. Therefore, the subscription process should be shortened and made easy to use, so that all customers can access and complete it quickly and easily.

## Split Data

Use **StratifiedShuffleSplit** to split the dataset into:  
- **Train set:** 70%  
- **Test set:** 30%

## Pipeline

Build a Pipeline:
- Applies a ColumnTransformer to:
  - One-Hot encode categorical features
  - Standard scale numerical features
  - Optionally applies SMOTE on the training data only
- The pipeline fits only the train set.

## Model
### Logistic Regression

| Metric               | Logistic Regression | Random Forest Classifier     |
|----------------------|---------------------|------------------------------|
| **ROC AUC**          | 0.893               | <mark>0.908</mark>           |
| **Gini Coefficient** | 0.786               | <mark>0.816</mark>           |
| **Accuracy**         | 0.84                | 0.83                         |
| **Precision**        | 0.63                | 0.63                         |
| **Recall**           | 1.00                | 0.91                         |
| **F1-score**         | 0.77                | 0.75                         |

## Overfitting/Underfitting
| Model                    | AUC (train)  | AUC (test) |   Overfitting   |   Underfitting   |
|--------------------------|--------------|------------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Logistic Regression**  | 0.913        | 0.893      | Not overfitting | Not underfitting |
| **Random Forest**        | 1.000        | 0.908      | Overfitting     | Not underfitting |

Based on the AUC results:
- Overfitting: The Logistic Regression model shows only a small difference of 0.02 between the AUC on the training set and the test set. This means the model is not overfitting and should work well when used in real situations. In contrast, the Random Forest model has a perfect AUC of 1.000 on the training set, but only 0.908 on the test set. Even though its test performance is still high, the large gap and the perfect score on the training set suggest that the model is overfitting.
- Underfitting: Both models have high AUC scores on both the training and test sets, so neither model is underfitting.

## Population Stability Index (PSI)
Interpreting PSI Values 
- Low PSI (e.g., < 0.1): Indicates little or no shift in the feature‚Äôs distribution between the datasets.
- Moderate PSI (e.g., 0.1 to 0.25): Indicates a moderate shift; you may need to monitor the variable.
- High PSI (e.g., > 0.25): Indicates a significant shift in the distribution, which might warrant further investigation or model recalibration.

**1. Numerical Features**
- PSI for Age: 0.0042 (LOW)
- PSI for Purchase_Amount_(USD): 0.0110 (LOW)
- PSI for Review_Rating: 0.0077 (LOW)
- PSI for Previous_Purchases: 0.0064 (LOW)

**2. Logistic Regression**
- PSI score: 0.0082 (LOW)
- AUC: 0.892
- Gini Coefficient: 0.784

**3. Random Forest**
- PSI score: 2.4896 (HIGH)
- AUC: 0.899
- Gini Coefficient: 0.798

## Cross Validation
Use **Stratified K-Fold** (5 splits) to compare two models:
| Model             | CV Mean   | Std      | Test Scores                                                                                                      |
|------------------|-----------|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| LogisticRegression | 0.894594  | 0.006228 | [0.8880534670008354, 0.9008746355685131, 0.9030399127069374, 0.8923502648377021, 0.8886493277196795]             |
| RandomForest       | 0.899493  | 0.004454 | [0.8978483624026052, 0.8956148875590337, 0.9082229382981263, 0.8976639956539454, 0.8981138802118702]             |

- Random Forest has a **slightly higher CV mean** than Logistic Regression.  
- Both models show **consistent performance** across folds.

> Although the Random Forest model has slightly better performance than Logistic Regression, the high PSI value shows a risk of instability when used with new data or in real-world situations. Moreover, the Random Forest model is overfitting. On the other hand, Logistic Regression gives similar results but has a low PSI, which means it is more stable and reliable for deployment. Therefore, I choose the **Logistic Regression model**.

# Deploy & Run ML Prediction Service with RabbitMQ (Docker)

## 1. Overview
This setup includes:
- An API (using FastAPI) that receives requests from clients
- RabbitMQ as the message broker
- A Consumer that reads messages from the queue, runs the ML model, and returns the result
All parts are packaged and run with Docker/Docker Compose.

## 2. Architecture
![image](./image/deploy_arc.png)

## 3. Implementation
**Step 1: Setup**
- Pull the RabbitMQ image from DockerHub
- Build the API (FastAPI) and the Consumer images
- Start all services using Docker Compose

*Notes:*
- Make sure the model and preprocessing files are in the consumer folder before building the Docker image.
- If you need to change the port or other configurations, edit `docker-compose.yml`.

**Step 2: Send a Prediction Request (using curl)**

Example:
```
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8081/predict" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "Age": 35,
    "Gender": "Male",
    "Category": "Clothing",
    "Purchase_Amount_(USD)": 49,
    "Size": "M",
    "Season": "Spring",
    "Review_Rating": 3.7,
    "Shipping_Type": "Express",
    "Promo_Code_Used": "Yes",
    "Previous_Purchases": 5,
    "Payment_Method": "Venmo",
    "Frequency_of_Purchases": "Weekly",
    "Region": "Midwest",
    "Color_Group": "Warm"
  }'
  ```
The request is sent to the API, and the API packages the data and sends the message to RabbitMQ.
![image](./image/demo_rabbit.jpg)

**Step 3: Check Prediction Results**
- View the result in the consumer logs: 
```
docker compose logs consumer
```
- Example:
```
consumer-1  | üöÄ Consumer run.
consumer-1  | ‚úÖ Successfully connected to RabbitMQ!
consumer-1  | Waiting for messages üîç
consumer-1  | Message received from queue: b'{"Age": 35, "Gender": "Male", "Category": "Clothing", "Purchase_Amount_(USD)": 49, "Size": "M", "Season": "Spring", "Review_Rating": 3.7, "Shipping_Type": "Express", "Promo_Code_Used": "Yes", "Previous_Purchases": 5, "Payment_Method": "Venmo", "Frequency_of_Purchases": "Weekly", "Region": "Midwest", "Color_Group": "Warm"}'
consumer-1  | ‚úÖ Probability: 0.80
consumer-1  | ‚úÖ Label: Subcribed
```
